Project Highlights:

Implemented Phong shading for the blue light source from the small planet onto the death star. 

Created and used 5 parametrically defined geometric objects:

Sphere for the Death Star body, laser hole, and small planet
Cylinder for the laser beam
Curved polygon for the laser glob that surrounds the planet

Used the Space Hull texture found online (https://www.123rf.com/photo_8971306_seamless-space-hull-ship-pattern-as-background.html) and mapped the texture to the Death Star body. 

Made a scene with multiple parametric objects using hierarchy and matrix transformations.
